# PUI2016 HW 8

Create a directory HW8_<netID> in your PUI repo (with your netID). 
  
Create a plot, of whatever data and or models you choose from the data of urban relevance (use your judgement here, but please no footbal statistics, or star flares. If you have doubt about whether your dataset is relevant for this homework please email me.) You can make the plot in any coding language you want, as long as you upload the code that generates the plot onto this repo (which means no tableau, or any other non reproducible method - carto is an exception, since you can see the processing tasks).

Please make an effor to make it a good, compelling graphic.
Put though into the esthetic of the plot, how clearly the content is communicated, avoid clutter, avoid misleading elements, mind your choice of colors accordingly to what was discussed in class. 

Each of you needs to upload their own plot, no group submissions. 

The plot neads to be uploaded onto the HW8 folder in your github PUI repo and **be embedded in the README.md**. That means: when I click on the HW8 link the plot must be rendered in the front page of the repo. Your readme must contain the plot, and a brief caption.  If it is an interactive graphic, upload a static image of it in the README and provide a link to the interactive version.

If your plot shows up as I described above in the repo and the code is also uploaded you will get 100% of the HW points. (Next week you will be tasked to review 3 plots of your classmates and you will be graded on the quality of the review.)
