# PUI2016 HW 9

## Different assignments are due on different dates due to thanksgiving. 

## Reading

This Politico article contains several quotes by CUSP Prof Julia Lane. 
[Is Washington Bungling the Census?](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/11/federal-data-collection-in-crisis-000537)

This article is politically charged. Generally I strive to give you impartial, non-political views on topics, but I could not find a more impartial paper on the issues the census is undergoing. Yet I think the census data is extremely important for you as urban scientist so you should pay attention to this.

Also if you are interested (but not mandatory):

[Historians and the Census: the Historiography of
Census Research)](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9478&context=annals-of-iowa)



## Assignment 1: reviews of classmates' plots. 
## Due next week, before thanksgiving.

You will recieve an email with 3 names and github handles of classmates. Review their plots according to the things we discussed last class. 

There will be detailed instructions in the email on how to review, what structure the review should have, what to focus on, etc. Please comply to the instructions. 
Upload the review **on your classmate's github PUI2017 repo** (not in your own repo, or _your fork_ of their repo!)

Each review will be reviewed and graded by me. (Please take this homework seriously: one sentence generic reviews will be graded 0)

## Assignment 2: census geospatial analysis. 
## Due in two weeks, the week after thanksgiving. 

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/) data (really the 1-year survey data) and at the same time to make you exercise with spatial analysis in geopandas.
The goal is to assess if the [linkNYC](https://www.link.nyc/) stations are located to provide a useful service and to fill in a need. You will work with the American Fact Finder data via API and direct download, and with NYC shapefiles.
The homework is long but you have 2 weeks to do it. If you leave it to the last minute you may have a hard time!
